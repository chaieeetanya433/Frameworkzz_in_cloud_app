            <p>
              Open the main Dart file (<code>main.dart</code>) in the{" "}
              <code>lib</code> directory. Replace the default code with a simple
              Flutter app code:
            </p>
            <pre>
              <code>
                import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
                <br />
                <br />
                void main() `{"{"}`<br />
                runApp(MyApp());
                <br />`{"}"}`<br />
                <br />
                class MyApp extends StatelessWidget `{"{"}`<br />
                @override
                <br />
                Widget build(BuildContext context) `{"{"}`<br />
                return MaterialApp(
                <br />
                home: Scaffold(
                <br />

                <br />
                body: Center(child: Text('Hello, Flutter!')),
                <br />
                ),
                <br />
                );
                <br />`{"}"}`<br />`{"}"}`
              </code>
            </pre>

            <h2>Step 4: Run Your Flutter App</h2>

            <h2>Choosing the Right Architecture</h2>
            <p>
              When building Flutter applications, selecting the appropriate
              architecture is crucial for maintaining a scalable and
              maintainable codebase. Flutter offers flexibility in architecture
              choices, with some popular options being:
            </p>

            <h3>BLoC (Business Logic Component)</h3>
            <p>
              The BLoC architecture separates business logic from UI components,
              enhancing code reusability and testability. It uses streams to
              manage state and events, ensuring a clear flow of data.
            </p>

            <h3>MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)</h3>
            <p>
              MVVM architecture separates concerns by dividing the application
              into Model (data), View (UI), and ViewModel (manages data for the
              UI). It promotes modularization and testability.
            </p>

            <h3>Clean Architecture</h3>
            <p>
              Clean Architecture emphasizes modularity, separating the
              application into distinct layers: Presentation, Domain, and Data.
              This architecture promotes maintainability and testability.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Principles</h2>
            <p>
              Regardless of the architecture you choose, these principles apply:
            </p>

            <h3>Separation of Concerns</h3>
            <p>
              Keep UI, business logic, and data manipulation separate to improve
              code maintainability and reusability.
            </p>

            <h3>Single Responsibility Principle</h3>
            <p>
              Ensure that each class or module has a single responsibility,
              making it easier to manage and test.
            </p>

            <h3>Dependency Injection</h3>
            <p>
              Use dependency injection to manage component dependencies,
              enabling flexibility and testability in your architecture.
            </p>

            <h2>Sample Implementation</h2>
            <p>
              For example, in a BLoC architecture, you might create a BLoC class
              to handle business logic, a UI class to display widgets, and a
              repository class to manage data fetching. By adhering to
              architecture principles, your codebase becomes more organized and
              maintainable.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <article>
            <p>
              Widgets are the fundamental building blocks of a Flutter
              application's user interface. They define the layout, structure,
              and behavior of the UI elements that users interact with.
            </p>

            <h2>What are Widgets?</h2>
            <p>
              In Flutter, everything is a widget. A widget can represent a
              simple visual element like a button, text, or image, or it can be
              a complex layout that combines multiple widgets.
            </p>

            <h2>Types of Widgets</h2>
            <p>
              Widgets in Flutter are categorized into two main types:
              StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>StatelessWidget:</strong> Represents an immutable widget
                that doesn't change over time. It's ideal for static UI
                elements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>StatefulWidget:</strong> Represents a mutable widget
                that can change its state over time. It's used for dynamic UI
                elements that need to update based on user interactions or data
                changes.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Widget Composition</h2>
            <p>
              Flutter allows you to compose widgets hierarchically to create
              complex user interfaces. You can nest widgets inside other widgets
              to build up your app's UI.
            </p>

            <h2>Hot Reload</h2>
            <p>
              One of the most powerful features of Flutter is the Hot Reload. It
              enables developers to instantly see the changes they make to the
              UI without restarting the app, making the development process
              faster and more efficient.
            </p>

            <h2>Widgets and Layouts</h2>
            <p>
              Widgets play a crucial role in defining layouts. Flutter provides
              a rich set of layout widgets that help you arrange your UI
              elements, control spacing, alignment, and responsiveness.
            </p>

            <p>
              This brief introduction gives you an overview of the significance
              of widgets in Flutter. To dive deeper and explore the world of
              widgets and UI development in Flutter, refer to the comprehensive
              documentation and tutorials provided by the Flutter team.

          <article>
            <p>
              Layouts are a fundamental aspect of building user interfaces in
              Flutter. They define how widgets are positioned and arranged
              within the app's UI. Flutter provides a rich set of layout widgets
              that allow you to create responsive and visually appealing
              designs.
            </p>

            <h2>Widgets as Building Blocks</h2>
            <p>
              In Flutter, everything is a widget, including layouts. Widgets
              serve as the building blocks for constructing UI elements. Layout
              widgets are specialized widgets designed to organize and control
              the placement of other widgets on the screen.
            </p>

            <h2>Basic Layout Widgets</h2>
            <p>Flutter offers a variety of layout widgets:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Container:</strong> A versatile widget for styling and
                layout customization.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Row:</strong> Arranges children horizontally in a row.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Column:</strong> Arranges children vertically in a
                column.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Stack:</strong> Overlays children, allowing for complex
                layouts.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Expanded:</strong> Expands to fill available space in a
                parent widget.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
            <p>
              Flutter's layout system supports responsive design out of the box.
              Widgets like <code>MediaQuery</code> and{" "}
              <code>LayoutBuilder</code> help you adapt your UI to different
              screen sizes and orientations.
            </p>

            <h2>Flexibility and Nesting</h2>
            <p>
              Flutter's composability allows you to nest layout widgets within
              each other to create intricate UI designs. This flexibility
              empowers you to build UIs that suit your app's requirements.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Mastering layouts in Flutter is essential for crafting appealing
              and functional user interfaces. Understanding how to use layout
              widgets effectively will enable you to create dynamic and
              responsive apps.
